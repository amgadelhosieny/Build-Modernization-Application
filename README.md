# Build-Modernization-Application

For this use case, you have identified a monolithic application in your company, and this application would be good candidate for modernization



# Challenges

1. The application is old and the application owner had left the company years ago without leaving any documentation behind.

2. You/your team is not an expert on the containerization process, so you do not feel comfortable with touching the application.

3. You/your team has recently started your Cloud Journey with AWS and you want to be sure whether you are following the Cloud Best practices while deploying the applications into the Cloud.

4. You/your team is very busy and can't spend too much time containerizing these applications.


# Solution

Revamping the legacy monolithic applications to be cloud native utilizing Microservices components to be integrated and used by other entities.
